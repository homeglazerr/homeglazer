                  Graffiti paintings are the murals that depict imagination. Graffiti paintings are very much expressive; it never goes out of trend. The painters paint on the wall a design or some scenario that has deep meaning. Many of us see some paintings on the walls for revolts, some cool and funky paintings in cafe, restaurants or any other space. Graffiti paintings are also very attractive when used to paint the bars and pubs.

We wait for a while to give that pleasure to our eyes seeing such amazing artworks.

                  When you hear the word "Graffiti Painting", your brain automatically creates a picture of some nonsense, meaningless art full of negativity and hatred that you might see on street walls. That's not true about Graffiti painting because it is much more beyond that. It can be a meaningful, beautiful, soulful form of art that spreads awareness.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Graffiti painting is such a pure art form. It is a democratic art by and for anyone, it offers so much but asks for so little. Graffiti is writing or drawings made on a wall or other surfaces, usually as a form of artistic expression.

                  Graffiti painting is a controversial subject. In most countries, marking or painting property without permission is considered by property owners and civic authorities as defacement and vandalism, which is a punishable crime. Many people see Graffiti as a social ill that contributes negatively to a city and society. However, Graffiti has now become a trend to convey emotions, messages and feelings to the public through art. Besides all this Graffiti has numerous positive benefits.

                  Individuals get the freedom to express themselves through graffiti. All you need is paint sprayers and an idea. Then, you can make every work of art you want. You can express an opinion or a political point and everyone will be able to see it.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Well-worked graffiti art is typically creative, colourful, and bold. Thus, it changes the character and vibe of the particular area where it appears. In many cases, this change is positive, since the art turns drab, monotone buildings and bare walls into interesting and eye-catching exhibitions of the imagination.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  For some, the problem lies in the medium; an individual might not enjoy traditional forms, such as painting and sculpture instance. While others fail to find art relevant within their lives. When graffiti is taught as an alternative medium of artwork, it may inspire these individuals.

                  Street art is important to keep urban areas and their residents energized and inspired. In some areas, artists and building owners come together to foster the creation of artwork that can be viewed as beautifying and reviving a city, rather than destroying it.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Spray paint is the most popular type of paint graffiti artists use because it's portable, extremely versatile and easy to get hold of. Ever since modern-day graffiti's early beginnings in the 1960s, spray paint has been the most popular medium for graffiti.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                But spray paint isn't the only type of paint graffiti and street artists use. Paint marker pens for tags and small mural details, plus emulsion paint for roller graffiti and preparing walls are also commonly used.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Spray paint is the most popular medium for most graffiti styles. The main reason it's so popular is that it provides maximum freedom and control whilst painting compared to more traditional methods. Anything imaginable can be painted using spray paint to achieve a range of effects.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Low pressure spray paint is characterised by its lower level of output. This is because low pressure paint allows for more control over the can, meaning it's easier to achieve finer lines and fewer drips.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  High pressure spray paint is defined by its higher level of paint output. High pressure paint is favoured by graffiti artists looking to get their pieces done quickly. It's also used by artists who are painting big pieces.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Although less iconic than spray paint, another popular medium for graffiti art is paint markers. Due to the lack of availability in the early days of graffiti, graffiti writers would often make their own paint markers.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Paint pump markers are characterised by their pump valve system. This means when the nib of the pen is pressed down on a surface, paint is released and flows down to the nib. This is unlike traditional gravity style markers.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Emulsion paint is your most common style of paint – the type that comes in a bucket and is used to paint things like walls and ceilings. Graffiti artists use emulsion paint more often than you'd think, especially for preparing walls before using spray paints.
